As Bower lets the law enforcers in, you begin working on a program meant for Peters' eyes only. With Bower making small talk, you're free to size your guests up and send her a list of their features and name tags. She'll be doing a check up on them to see if everyone's identity comes up clean. Each of the 5 persons has a body type category, a name and a list of traits. Create a file that contains their basic profiles.

The application has a graphical user interface (Qt framework) and allows to:

- Visualize all profiles in a list (QListWidget or QListView). When the application starts, the list is populated automatically, showing the category and the name of the profile.
- Allows the user to search profiles, by category or name. There will be a QLineEdit and as the user types in this line edit, the list is refreshed, containing only the profiles whose category or name match the searched text. The matching is not exact.
- For a given profile, shows its traits in another list. The name of the profile is given in a QLineEdit and when the button “Show traits” is clicked, a new list will be populated, with the profile's traits (the list will have as many items as there are traits).
